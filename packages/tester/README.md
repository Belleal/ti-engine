Flexible framework for the creation of microservices with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Introduction

The **ti-engine** is an open source, free to use—both for personal and commercial projects—framework for the creation of microservice-based solutions using **node.js**.
The architectural concept of the framework is based on a standard _messaging system_ that allows for certain customization but also provides predictability and traceability of its behavior.

## Why ti-engine?

The framework is created based on a decade of professional experience with the utilized technologies and architectural approach. Its primary goal is to provide you with a lightweight and flexible solution that can help you quickly build a microservice ecosystem with any degree of size and complexity.

This is what you gain by using **ti-engine** in your project:

* **Simplicity**: Begin productive work within minutes and get to codding your business logic
* **Flexibility**: Go as complex as you need to in your implementation
* **Reliability**: Message exchange between the services is constantly tracked across the entire ecosystem
* **Security**: Messages are encrypted in transit and cannot be modified by external agents
* **Scalability**: Serve mullions of requests by multiplying stateless service instances (hardware limitations still apply)
* **Containerization**: Go with containers from the very start as the framework is designed to work in such an environment

These are just some benefits **ti-engine** offers. Get to know it better to find out more ways in which it can help you improve productivity.

## Information

This is the tester module for the **ti-engine** framework. It is created as an example microservice that can help you understand how the framework works.
