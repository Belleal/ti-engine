# ti-engine
Flexible framework for the creation of microservices with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Introduction

The **ti-engine** is an open source, free to use—both for personal and commercial projects—framework for the creation of microservice-based solutions using **node.js**.
The architectural concept of the framework is based on a standard _messaging system_ that allows for certain customization but also provides predictability and traceability of its behavior.

## Why ti-engine?

The framework is created based on a decade of professional experience with the utilized technologies and architectural approach.
It's primary goal is to provide you with a lightweight and flexible solution that can help you build quickly a microservice ecosystem with any degree of size and complexity.

This is what you gain by using **ti-engine** in your project:

* Simplicity: begin productive work within minutes and get to codding you business logic
* Flexibility: go as complex as you need to in your implementation
* Reliability: message exchange between the services is constantly tracked across the entire ecosystem
* Security: messages are encrypted in transit and cannot be modified by external agents
* Scalability: serve mullions of requests by multiplying stateless service instances (hardware limitations still apply)
* Containerization: go with containers from the very start as the framework is designed to work in such an environment

These are just some benefits **ti-engine** offers. Get to know it better to find out more ways in which it can help you improve productivity.

For more information and getting started guide please read the documentation of the individual packages:

* [ti-engine/core](https://github.com/Belleal/ti-engine/tree/master/packages/core) - This is the framework itself and there you can find the main documentation.
* [ti-engine/tester](https://github.com/Belleal/ti-engine/tree/master/packages/tester) - This is a sample tester microservice build with the framework.
