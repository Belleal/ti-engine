## Supported Versions

I'll generally support only the **latest minor version** of the framework. If you have issues with an older version it would be best to update to latest supported one. Check the table below for current status.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- |--------------------|
| 1.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.1.x   | :x:                |
| 1.0.x   | :x:                |
